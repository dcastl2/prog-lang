How to Download the GitHub Material to Your Account
===================================================

Once you are logged in to the server, simply type

  git clone https://github.com/dcastl2/prog-lang

which will create a folder called ``prog-lang`` which contains all the contents
of this repository.  This includes binary files for programs.  Change into the
directory ``assg/prog1/bin``, for example, to get to the for the binaries for
prog1.  You can execute these binaries to see the expected program behavior.
You will also find starter codes for assignments. For example, see
``assg/prog1/src`` for codes which are useful for completing the assignment.

From time to time, I will update the repository with more information,
assignments, and notes.  To receive the latest changes, go to the top-level
directory of the repository and simply type

  git pull

Then your copy of the repository will be up-to-date.  If you find the folder
name ``prog-lang`` to long, you can rename it (to ``repo``, for example),
without affecting anything.  You will still be able to pull changes.
