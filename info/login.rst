   do not type literally 'username', but rather your login ID to the server.

3. For the first access, you may be asked if you would like to proceed; type yes
   and hit Enter to do so.

4. Type in your supplied password. Note that you will not be able to see it as

   as the number 1 and letter 'l', the number 0 and letter 'O', the symbol 
   letter 't', dashes and underscores, etc.

5. You should now be logged in.

5. When it prompts for a login, enter your login ID (cs4101xx).

6. Finally, enter your password to login. Note that your password will not be
   visible to you as you type it.  Be sure to distinguish among lookalike
   characters such as the number 1 and letter 'l', the number 0 and letter 'O',
   the symbol letter 't', dashes and underscores, etc.

7. You should now be logged in and able to use the system.



A note about PuTTY
==================

The use of PuTTY as an SSH client for Windows users is a tradition in our
department.  Most of you will have used PuTTY.  There are alternatives to PuTTY
which you are free to use.  If you have a preferred SSH client, use it instead.
A Linux Live CD is also an option if you want the features of Linux ssh, but
don't want to commit to installing Linux to your hard drive.
