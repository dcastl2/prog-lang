This is a guide to the course information and the recommended order to read
the documents in.


**Read the following as soon as possible** so that you know what you are
committing to:

* ``syllabus.rst`` contains the syllabus.  Read this first; it gives a general
  overview of what to expect from the course.

* ``calendar.rst`` has a calendar which gives a topic list and the due dates of
  assignments and tests.  Refer to this to anticipate what will come next.

* ``grading.rst`` has my draconian grading policy and an explanation of how
  my problems are formatted.  Read it carefully before you decide to commit
  to the course.

* ``conduct.rst`` has my conduct policy.  The words in my conduct policy are
  the most unpleasant I will ever say to you, unless you decide to violate my
  conduct policy.


**Read the following once you have access to your login credentials**:

* ``login.rst`` contains instructions for logging in to the server, but these
  will only prove useful once you have login credentials to the Linux server.

* ``commands.rst`` has a list of basic commands which can be used on the
  Linux server, but only after logging in to it.

* ``git.rst`` gives instructions on how to clone my git repository so that
  you may have access to notes and codes from the class under your local
  account on the Linux server.

* ``submission.rst`` contains instructions for assignment submission, which
  is something you need to do after you complete your first assignment.
