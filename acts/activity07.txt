1. Write the function ``size :: Queue -> Int`` which computes the size of a
   queue.





























2. Write the function ``delete :: List -> Int -> List`` which finds the
   first occurrence of a node with an integer and returns a list with
   that node removed.






























3. Write the function ``reverse :: Stack -> Stack`` which returns the reverse
   of a stack.
   
























4. Write the function ``isBalanced :: Tree -> Bool`` which checks to see
   if the tree is balanced.  A tree is balanced if the heights of the left 
   and right subtrees differ by no more than one.
