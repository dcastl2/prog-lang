1. Define LR parser, shift and reduce operations, and context-free language.
   Also give the informal definition of a phrase.






























2. Give the formal definitions of handle and simple phrase. According to
   the definition, what are two ways in which a handle may be different 
   from a simple phrase?  How is a handle in a rightmost derivation defined 
   in terms of simple phrase?






   





















3. Draw a pushdown automaton for the language 0ⁿ1²ⁿ, n ∈ N.


























4. Write a Haskell function with signature ``series :: (Int -> Float) -> (Int
   -> Float)`` which accepts a function to compute the nth element of a 
   sequence and returns a function which is the finite series from 1 to n of 
   that sequence.
