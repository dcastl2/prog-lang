1. Re-write the following grammar to avoid direct left recursion.

   A -> A * B | B
   B -> B - C | B + C
   D -> x | y | z



























2. Apply the pairwise disjointness test to the nonterminal A of the 
   following grammar.  Re-write the grammar such that it parses the
   same language but is pairwise-disjoint.

   A -> aC | bB
   B -> C  | aC
   C -> b
   
























3. Draw a pushdown automaton for the grammar 0²ⁿ1ⁿ, n ∈ N.



























4. Write a Haskell function with signature ``integrate ::
   (Float -> Float) -> (Float -> Float)`` which accepts a
   function and returns the function which is the integral 
   of the input function.
