1. Write a code in Haskell with signature ``spaces :: [Char] -> Int`` which
   counts the number of spaces in a string.





























2. Write a Haskell code with signature ``log2 :: Int -> Int`` which 
   accepts an integer and determines its base-2 logarithm, rounded
   down, without the aid of any math functions except division.






























3. Write a Haskell code with signature ``search :: [Int] -> Int -> Bool`` which
   determines if a given integer resides in the integer list.


























4. Wite a Haskell code with signature ``rrotate :: [Int] -> Int -> Int`` which 
   right-rotates an integer list by n elements.
