1. Use the rules of assignment and sequence to find the precondition for
   the following code:

   x = x - 1
   y = x + 1
   {y > 5}



























2. Use the rule of selection to find the precondition for the following
   code.  You will need to find both preconditions and combine them using
   a little math.

   if x > 0
      x = x - 1
   else
      x = x + 1
   {x = 0}






















3. Find the loop invariant for the following:

   x = 1
   while x < 16
   do
     x = 2 * x
   end
   {x = 16}
   






















4. Write a Haskell code with signature ``dig_root :: Int -> Int`` which finds
   the digital root of an integer.  The digital root of an integer is the
   sum of its digits, recursively applied until a single digit is obtained.
