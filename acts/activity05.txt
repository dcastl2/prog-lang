1. (a) Define and (b) give the purpose of the three types of semantics.































2. Give the operational semantics for the following C code using a simpler
   intermediate language.

   x = 10;
   do {
    x = (x % 2 == 0) ? x : x-1;
   } while (x--);

























3. Find the weakest precondition for the following statement and postcondition
   using the rule of assignment. Then using the rule of inference, prove the
   Hoare triple below it.

   x = x + 1 {x>0}
   {x>0} x = x + 1 {x>0}

























4. Write a Haskell code with signature ``sqrt :: Float -> Float`` which finds
   the square root of a floating-point number within 1e-2 accuracy.
