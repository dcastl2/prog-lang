1. Write a Prolog program which defines father, mother, grandmother, and
   grandfather, in terms of male, female, parent.





























2. Write a Prolog program which defines sum(X,Y), where Y is the sum of
   numbers from 1 to X.






























3. Write a BF program which multiplies two numbers in Cell 0 and Cell 1
   into Cell 2.


























4. Write a Haskell program which accepts two functions, f and g, and a value x.
   It returns the derivative at a point for composed functions:

    chain :: (Float -> Float) -> (Float -> Float) -> Float -> Float 

    (f ∘ g)' = (f' ∘ g) ⋅ g'

   at the point x.  You may assume you have the function for computing
   derivatives at a point, whose signature is:

    dd :: (Float -> Float) -> Float -> Float
