Due Sunday, January 15th at 6:00:00.000 PM.  You must complete both of the
problems.


1. A personality test.
     [16] Fill out the TIPI (Ten Item Peronsality Inventory) in this directory,
     and include the filled-out form in your submission of ``prog0``.


2. Your first Haskell program.
     [16] Write a Haskell program called ``hello.hs`` which prints "Hello,
     world!" to the screen.  Do a little on-line research to find out how to
     write such a program in Haskell. Test it with the Haskell compiler
     ``ghc``.  It should compile with:

        ``ghc hello.hs``
